Files placed in this directory will be deployed to the RoboRIO into the
'deploy' directory in the home folder. Use the 'Filesystem.getDeployDirectory' wpilib function
to get a proper path relative to the deploy directory.

For prior bots - put robot specific files under <bot-name>/deploy. They get copied at start up to the
correct relative location.
